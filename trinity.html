<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Trinity was founded in April 20, 1869. Trinity University is the #1 Private School in the Regional Universities West, and #1 in Best Value Schools.  </p>
<div style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 10px;"><img src="Trinity_fountain.jpg"><br>Photo courtesy of Trinity University</div> </p> <p> Trinity has a beautiful campus, and many wonderful programs that are offered for anyone interested in anything. There are also many extracurricular programs, such as Trinity Choir and Theatre. Trinity is very hard to get into, having a acceptance rate of 34% for the school year of 2019.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the teachers and the relative small school size. I enjoy the small school size because to teachers I am more than a number, but an actual person. The teachers are also super nice and helpful.</p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because</p>
<p>I am majoring in Business Analytics and Technology because I find that reviewing data, extrapolating from said data is an interesting topic and I want to work somewhere that I feel I can make an impact. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
